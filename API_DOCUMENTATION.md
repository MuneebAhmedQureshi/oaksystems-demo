## Rate Limiting

API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse:
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per minute
- Standard endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- Bulk operations: 10 requests per minute

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following parameters:
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `page_size`: Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

Pagination response format:
```json
{
  "count": 100,
  "next": "http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint/?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [...]
}
```

## Filtering and Searching

Most list endpoints support filtering and searching:
- `search`: Full-text search across relevant fields
- `ordering`: Sort by field (prefix with `-` for descending)
- Field-specific filters vary by endpoint

Example:
```
GET /tasks/assessments/?search=invoice&automation_suitability=highly_automatable&ordering=-created_at
```
